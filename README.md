# AtomREST
RESTful server for Atomproekt JSC

The project is intended to make usual working routines for engineers easier, simpler and more convenient.

Based on an API with RESTful design, it can do plenty of things and be integrated almost everywhere. As of right now, there are some apps in project:

- AtomBase. Base app, that serves as the source of basic information about structure of current working process.

- [WIP] EasyView. App that allows to work with 3D-models right in a browser. Live demo: https://easyviewapp.herokuapp.com/

- [TODO] Checker. App that checks documents in .docx format and inserts remarks if something is wrong with it.

Now it is work-in-progress mostly.
